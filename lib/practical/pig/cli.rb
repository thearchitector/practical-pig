      `pig new` will generate a new Ruby on Rails application and modify it
      to adhere to Practical Pig's application design guidelines.

      The APP_PATH you provide will be used as the path of the application during
      creation, with its name being the basename (last part of the path). In every
      case, the new application will be generated relative to the current working
      directory (where you execute this command).

      By design, your application name must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

      This command makes use of `rails new` under the hood but does not accept
      any generator options.
